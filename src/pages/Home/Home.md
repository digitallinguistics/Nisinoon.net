  <h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This project is an NSF-funded cross-linguistic database of the components which make up words in Algonquian languages. There are two main goals:</p>

  <ol class=goals>
    <li>To provide tribes with a source for lexical expansion for their language revitalization/reclamation projects.</li>
    <li>To provide a basis for comprehensive reconstruction of Proto-Algonquian.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This database will be a web-based, open-access, centralized resource for Algonquian word components, providing community members and linguists with a set of data that has previously been difficult to access.</p>

## What does Nisinoon mean? {% include 'backlink' %} {#nisinoon-meaning}

[Nisinoon][nisinoon-entry] is an Ojibwe word meaning 'there are three'. We chose it to represent the tripartite structure of Algonquian words: initial-medial-final. Click on the word to learn more about the word and hear it pronounced.

## Algonquian Components Bibliography {% include 'backlink' %} {#bibliography}

The [Algonquian Components Bibliography](/bibliography) is a set of resources used in the Nisinoon project to collect data on derivational morphemes in Algonquian languages. It was compiled by [Monica Macaulay][website-monica] (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and [Hunter Lockwood][website-hunter] (Myaamia Center, Miami University) with the help of Rachel Fedorchak, Anushri Kartik-Narayan, Eleanor Sand, and Savana Stauss. Please let us know if you find any errors in the references.
