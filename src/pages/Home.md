# Nisinoon

A multilingual dictionary database of Algonquian derivational morphemes

![stylized trillium flower icon](/images/trillium.svg)

This project is an NSF-funded cross-linguistic database of the components which make up words in Algonquian languages. There are two main goals:

1. To provide tribes with a source for lexical expansion for their language revitalization/reclamation projects.
2. To provide a basis for comprehensive reconstruction of Proto-Algonquian.

This database will be a web-based, open-access, centralized resource for Algonquian word components, providing community members and linguists with a set of data that has previously been difficult to access.

## What does Nisinoon mean?

[Nisinoon][nisinoon-entry] is an Ojibwe word meaning 'there are three'. We chose it to represent the tripartite structure of Algonquian words: initial-medial-final. Click on the word to learn more about the word and hear it pronounced.

## Bibliography

The [Algonquian Components Bibliography](/bibliography) is a set of resources used in the Nisinoon project to collect data on derivational morphemes in Algonquian languages. It was compiled by [Monica Macaulay][website-monica] (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and [Hunter Lockwood][website-hunter] (Myaamia Center, Miami University) with the help of Rachel Fedorchak, Anushri Kartik-Narayan, Eleanor Sand, and Savana Stauss.
