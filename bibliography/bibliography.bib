	abstract = {Sociophonetics is a sub-branch that has attracted attention recently. Advances in speech science and technological simulations allow increasingly sophisticated studies of language contact and change. Particularly at the level of pronunciation, these studies show that language variety is robust and socially embedded. Although the book assumes some knowledge of basic acoustics and variationist studies, the general introduction and the chapter and section introductions provide a review of practices in the field, including those of collection, analysis, and interpretation. Introduction: Sociophonetic studies of language variety production – And perception / Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis R. Preston – Part I. Studies of Production: 1. The Peripatetic History of Middle English / Alice Faber, Marianna Di Paolo, and Catherine T. Best – 2. Social and phonetic conditioners on the frequency and degree of 'intrusive /r/' in New Zealand English / Jen Hay and Margaret Maclagan – 3. Mexican-American identity and the acquisition of regional US English / Rebecca Roeder – 4. Rhythm types and the speech of working-class youth in a banlieue of Paris: The role of vowel elision and devoicing / Zsuzsanna Fagyal – 5. The sociophonetics of prosodic contours on NEG in three language communities: Teasing apart sociolinguistic and phonetic influences on speech / Malcah Yaeger-Dror, Shoji Takano, Tania Granadillo, and Lauren Hall-Lew – 6. An emerging gender difference in Japanese vowel devoicing / Terumi Imai, Wittenberg College – Part II. Studies of Perception: 7. Regional stereotypes and the perception of Japanese vowel devoicing / Midori Yonezawa Morris – 8. Phonetic detail, linguistic experience, and the classification of regional language varieties in the United States / Cynthia G. Clopper – 9. Regional identity and the comprehension of varieties / Bartek Plichta and Brad Rakerd – 10. Belle's body just caught the fit gnat: The perception of Northern Cities Shifted vowels by local speakers / Dennis R. Preston – 11. Linguistic security, ideology, and vowel perception / Nancy Niedzielski – 12. Identification of African American speech / Erik R. Thomas, Norman E. Lass, and Jeannine Carpenter – Part III. Studies of perception and production: 13. Phonetic detail in the perception of ethnic varieties of US English / Thomas Purnell – 14. Sound judgements: Perception of indexical features in children's speech / Paul Foulkes, Gerard Docherty, Ghada Khattab, and Malcah Yaeger-Dror – 15. Avant-garde Dutch: A perceptual, acoustic and evaluational study / Renee van Bezooijen and Vincent J. van Heuven – 16.

	abstract = {Sociophonetics is a sub-branch that has attracted attention recently. Advances in speech science and technological simulations allow increasingly sophisticated studies of language contact and change. Particularly at the level of pronunciation, these studies show that language variety is robust and socially embedded. Although the book assumes some knowledge of basic acoustics and variationist studies, the general introduction and the chapter and section introductions provide a review of practices in the field, including those of collection, analysis, and interpretation. Introduction: Sociophonetic studies of language variety production – And perception / Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis R. Preston – Part I. Studies of Production: 1. The Peripatetic History of Middle English / Alice Faber, Marianna Di Paolo, and Catherine T. Best – 2. Social and phonetic conditioners on the frequency and degree of 'intrusive /r/' in New Zealand English / Jen Hay and Margaret Maclagan – 3. Mexican-American identity and the acquisition of regional US English / Rebecca Roeder – 4. Rhythm types and the speech of working-class youth in a banlieue of Paris: The role of vowel elision and devoicing / Zsuzsanna Fagyal – 5. The sociophonetics of prosodic contours on NEG in three language communities: Teasing apart sociolinguistic and phonetic influences on speech / Malcah Yaeger-Dror, Shoji Takano, Tania Granadillo, and Lauren Hall-Lew – 6. An emerging gender difference in Japanese vowel devoicing / Terumi Imai, Wittenberg College – Part II. Studies of Perception: 7. Regional stereotypes and the perception of Japanese vowel devoicing / Midori Yonezawa Morris – 8. Phonetic detail, linguistic experience, and the classification of regional language varieties in the United States / Cynthia G. Clopper – 9. Regional identity and the comprehension of varieties / Bartek Plichta and Brad Rakerd – 10. Belle's body just caught the fit gnat: The perception of Northern Cities Shifted vowels by local speakers / Dennis R. Preston – 11. Linguistic security, ideology, and vowel perception / Nancy Niedzielski – 12. Identification of African American speech / Erik R. Thomas, Norman E. Lass, and Jeannine Carpenter – Part III. Studies of perception and production: 13. Phonetic detail in the perception of ethnic varieties of US English / Thomas Purnell – 14. Sound judgements: Perception of indexical features in children's speech / Paul Foulkes, Gerard Docherty, Ghada Khattab, and Malcah Yaeger-Dror – 15. Avant-garde Dutch: A perceptual, acoustic and evaluational study / Renee van Bezooijen and Vincent J. van Heuven – 16.

	doi = {10.1007/s11525-016-9299-y},
	abstract = {This paper identifies two difficulties with treatments of derivation in Algonquian languages. In traditional approaches to grammar, in which the morpheme is seen as a unitary entity, morphemes are understood as minimal units of meaning and/or function. Definitions share an appeal to the morpheme’s indivisibility. In the Algonquianist literature, in contrast, some morphemes (‘components’) can themselves contain other morphemes (which we call ‘formatives’) and they can also be synchronically derived from other components or stems. Drawing data from Menominee, we propose that these difficulties disappear if the formatives are seen as historical rather than synchronic units, while the components are the synchronic morphemes. Formatives bear the hallmarks of historical products of morphologization (phonetic/phonological reduction, semantic bleaching, and increase in grammatical function), and we conclude that they are not part of synchronic grammatical computation. This resolves problems present in traditional and modern theoretical approaches to Algonquian derivation, and has broader ramifications for linguistic theory: in both the structuralist and generativist traditions, synchronic grammar has often been seen as expansive, responsible for generating surface patterns that may instead be products of history. This has been the case in phonology and syntax. The present paper provides a study of the phenomenon in derivational morphology, and suggests that a more modest role for synchronic rules is called for.},

	abstract = {Blackfoot verbal stems are usually classified by transitivity and animacy of the object (Taylor 1969, Frantz 1971, 1995), while the interaction between roots and suffixes remains uncharted. This paper argues that Blackfoot verbal roots and transitivity suffixes form heterogeneous subclasses based on their intrinsic transitivity. 1 Traditional classification of Blackfoot verbal stems Traditionally, verbal stems (root plus affixes) in Blackfoot are sub-classified on the basis of transitivity as well as the animacy of their argument. Intransitives verbs have one argument. Transitive stems require two arguments. In addition, all transitive stems are distinctly marked depending on whether their object is grammatically animate or inanimate. Similarly, intransitive verbs are traditionally sub-classified depending on the animacy of their subject. This stem-argument interaction is captured in the following classification: (1) Traditional classification of verbal stems in Algonquian (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] TA (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] TI (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] AI (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] II I will now go over the elements of the template. The preverb position hosts modal, temporal, aspectual and modifying prefixes. Suffixes that signal the transitivity (i.e., number of arguments) of the verb are analyzed as finals. Medials are modifying suffixes (mostly encoding manner). Preverbs and medials are not present in every verbal complex, while roots and finals are always required. Roots are simplex sound-meaning correspondences that finals and medials attach to when a stem is formed. As such, roots are essentially defined by their morpho-syntactic position. Animate transitive stems are TA, inanimate transitive-TI, animate intransitive-AI, and inanimate intransitive-II. Intransitive also includes pseudo intransitives (where an argument is optional). In (2), I illustrate how the template applies to a predicate: (2) áakaaminnima 2 yaak-ø-yaam-inn-i-wa},

The relevant facts are viewed from the perspective of the Distributed Morphology (DM) model of grammar (see, for example, Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994). The aim of this paper is to provide a unitary account of three previously unrelated facts. These are: (1) i. Allomorphy within the verb stem. ii. Certain morphemes occur either within the verb stem, or in “preverb position” (to the left of the verb stem). iii. In certain contexts, normal scopal relations within the verb stem are reversed.},

	abstract = {The qualifications needed for senior posts in academic libraries are 1. academic subject knowledge, to first degree level, but increasingly to higher degree level; 2. administrative and executive ability and experience; 3. knowledge of languages; 4. professional qualification in library techniques and bibliography. It is impossible to recruit staff with all these qualifications, particularly if higher degrees are required. Full-time library education following first degree will continue to be a normal route for entry to work in academic libraries, but this must be supplemented for those with higher degrees and mature entrants to the profession. The training of professional library staff must not be regarded as a once-for-all matter, but as a process continuing through life. Present facilities for part-time study are unsatisfactory. There is a need for the systematic organization of courses for those already in employment. These should be short, intensive, full-time courses, of the summer-school type, each dealing with one subject. Some such courses are now being organized, but they are not systematized and lead to no qualification. A programme of such courses, run by universities, library schools, libraries, and library organizations could be promoted by the Library Association and recognized for formal qualification. These courses would also provide for the need of practising librarians for ???refresher??? courses and training in new aspects of librarianship. ?? 1966, MCB UP Limited},

	abstract = {As an introduction to the major features of the Cree language, this book responds first of all to a practical need: to explore the structure of Cree, to compare it with that of English, and to identify some of the difficulties which speakers of either language experience in learning to speak the other. The first edition of Meet Cree, published in Canada in 1973, was addressed mainly to teachers, nurses, and other Euro-Canadians who live and work in communities speaking Cree, the most widely spoken indigenous language of Canada. The book was also used in courses on the structure of Cree and as background reading in spoken language programs. This new edition is meant as well for a third audience—general readers who may turn to a brief book on the Cree language simply from curiosity. Because virtually no other book presents a linguistic overview of any Native American language so soundly in terms of scholarship and pedagogy and yet so succinctly and clearly, Meet Cree has a special appeal for linguists and language teachers in the United States.},

	abstract = {Sociophonetics is a sub-branch that has attracted attention recently. Advances in speech science and technological simulations allow increasingly sophisticated studies of language contact and change. Particularly at the level of pronunciation, these studies show that language variety is robust and socially embedded. Although the book assumes some knowledge of basic acoustics and variationist studies, the general introduction and the chapter and section introductions provide a review of practices in the field, including those of collection, analysis, and interpretation. Introduction: Sociophonetic studies of language variety production – And perception / Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis R. Preston – Part I. Studies of Production: 1. The Peripatetic History of Middle English / Alice Faber, Marianna Di Paolo, and Catherine T. Best – 2. Social and phonetic conditioners on the frequency and degree of 'intrusive /r/' in New Zealand English / Jen Hay and Margaret Maclagan – 3. Mexican-American identity and the acquisition of regional US English / Rebecca Roeder – 4. Rhythm types and the speech of working-class youth in a banlieue of Paris: The role of vowel elision and devoicing / Zsuzsanna Fagyal – 5. The sociophonetics of prosodic contours on NEG in three language communities: Teasing apart sociolinguistic and phonetic influences on speech / Malcah Yaeger-Dror, Shoji Takano, Tania Granadillo, and Lauren Hall-Lew – 6. An emerging gender difference in Japanese vowel devoicing / Terumi Imai, Wittenberg College – Part II. Studies of Perception: 7. Regional stereotypes and the perception of Japanese vowel devoicing / Midori Yonezawa Morris – 8. Phonetic detail, linguistic experience, and the classification of regional language varieties in the United States / Cynthia G. Clopper – 9. Regional identity and the comprehension of varieties / Bartek Plichta and Brad Rakerd – 10. Belle's body just caught the fit gnat: The perception of Northern Cities Shifted vowels by local speakers / Dennis R. Preston – 11.

	doi = {10.1007/s11525-016-9299-y},
	abstract = {This paper identifies two difficulties with treatments of derivation in Algonquian languages. In traditional approaches to grammar, in which the morpheme is seen as a unitary entity, morphemes are understood as minimal units of meaning and/or function. Definitions share an appeal to the morpheme’s indivisibility. In the Algonquianist literature, in contrast, some morphemes (‘components’) can themselves contain other morphemes (which we call ‘formatives’) and they can also be synchronically derived from other components or stems. Drawing data from Menominee, we propose that these difficulties disappear if the formatives are seen as historical rather than synchronic units, while the components are the synchronic morphemes. Formatives bear the hallmarks of historical products of morphologization (phonetic/phonological reduction, semantic bleaching, and increase in grammatical function), and we conclude that they are not part of synchronic grammatical computation. This resolves problems present in traditional and modern theoretical approaches to Algonquian derivation, and has broader ramifications for linguistic theory: in both the structuralist and generativist traditions, synchronic grammar has often been seen as expansive, responsible for generating surface patterns that may instead be products of history. This has been the case in phonology and syntax. The present paper provides a study of the phenomenon in derivational morphology, and suggests that a more modest role for synchronic rules is called for.},

	abstract = {Blackfoot verbal stems are usually classified by transitivity and animacy of the object (Taylor 1969, Frantz 1971, 1995), while the interaction between roots and suffixes remains uncharted. This paper argues that Blackfoot verbal roots and transitivity suffixes form heterogeneous subclasses based on their intrinsic transitivity. 1 Traditional classification of Blackfoot verbal stems Traditionally, verbal stems (root plus affixes) in Blackfoot are sub-classified on the basis of transitivity as well as the animacy of their argument. Intransitives verbs have one argument. Transitive stems require two arguments. In addition, all transitive stems are distinctly marked depending on whether their object is grammatically animate or inanimate. Similarly, intransitive verbs are traditionally sub-classified depending on the animacy of their subject. This stem-argument interaction is captured in the following classification: (1) Traditional classification of verbal stems in Algonquian (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] TA (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] TI (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] AI (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] II I will now go over the elements of the template. The preverb position hosts modal, temporal, aspectual and modifying prefixes. Suffixes that signal the transitivity (i.e., number of arguments) of the verb are analyzed as finals. Medials are modifying suffixes (mostly encoding manner). Preverbs and medials are not present in every verbal complex, while roots and finals are always required. Roots are simplex sound-meaning correspondences that finals and medials attach to when a stem is formed. As such, roots are essentially defined by their morpho-syntactic position. Animate transitive stems are TA, inanimate transitive-TI, animate intransitive-AI, and inanimate intransitive-II. Intransitive also includes pseudo intransitives (where an argument is optional). In (2), I illustrate how the template applies to a predicate: (2) áakaaminnima 2 yaak-ø-yaam-inn-i-wa},

The relevant facts are viewed from the perspective of the Distributed Morphology (DM) model of grammar (see, for example, Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994). The aim of this paper is to provide a unitary account of three previously unrelated facts. These are: (1) i. Allomorphy within the verb stem. ii. Certain morphemes occur either within the verb stem, or in “preverb position” (to the left of the verb stem). iii. In certain contexts, normal scopal relations within the verb stem are reversed.},

	abstract = {The qualifications needed for senior posts in academic libraries are 1. academic subject knowledge, to first degree level, but increasingly to higher degree level; 2. administrative and executive ability and experience; 3. knowledge of languages; 4. professional qualification in library techniques and bibliography. It is impossible to recruit staff with all these qualifications, particularly if higher degrees are required. Full-time library education following first degree will continue to be a normal route for entry to work in academic libraries, but this must be supplemented for those with higher degrees and mature entrants to the profession. The training of professional library staff must not be regarded as a once-for-all matter, but as a process continuing through life. Present facilities for part-time study are unsatisfactory. There is a need for the systematic organization of courses for those already in employment. These should be short, intensive, full-time courses, of the summer-school type, each dealing with one subject. Some such courses are now being organized, but they are not systematized and lead to no qualification. A programme of such courses, run by universities, library schools, libraries, and library organizations could be promoted by the Library Association and recognized for formal qualification. These courses would also provide for the need of practising librarians for ???refresher??? courses and training in new aspects of librarianship. ?? 1966, MCB UP Limited},

The first edition of Meet Cree, published in Canada in 1973, was addressed mainly to teachers, nurses, and other Euro-Canadians who live and work in communities speaking Cree, the most widely spoken indigenous language of Canada. The book was also used in courses on the structure of Cree and as background reading in spoken language programs. This new edition is meant as well for a third audience—general readers who may turn to a brief book on the Cree language simply from curiosity. Because virtually no other book presents a linguistic overview of any Native American language so soundly in terms of scholarship and pedagogy and yet so succinctly and clearly, Meet Cree has a special appeal for linguists and language teachers in the United States.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {It took 25 years to develop and arrive at a consensus for a standard orthography for the language of the Innu, or Montagnais, who live in Quebec and Labrador. The principal obstacle to standardization came from dialect diversity. An effort at standardizing the spelling system in the 1970s failed because speakers were not ready to let go of the writing system for their particular dialect, and they rejected a system that did not match their pronunciation. Another initiative in the 1980s made clear that speakers were to keep their accent, even when the spelling was standardized. A recognized authority for standardization of the spelling system was formed in the mid-1980s. At workshops attended by teachers and translators from all Innu communities, the orthography was largely standardized, although not all dialect variations were settled. A permanent committee formed in 1990 was charged with making decisions pertaining to standardization of spelling. Another series of workshops in 1997 tackled the problem of verb conjugations, and a consensus was reached on principles and rules for a common writing system. The work of promoting the spelling norm needs to be carried out for the whole population. Targeting young children is important because they have not yet acquired spelling habits and are not attached to any particular tradition. If the teaching of the Innu language were given more room in the school curriculum, the dissemination of the common spelling system could move forward. (Contains 18 references.) (TD)},

	abstract = {This paper examines how democracy affects long-run growth by influencing the quality of governance. Empirical evidence is presented showing that the quality of governance is substantially higher in democratic countries. A general-equilibrium, endogenous growth model is then built to show how a governance-improving democracy raises growth. In this model, stronger democratic institutions influence governance by constraining the actions of corrupt officials. Reducing corruption, in turn, stimulates technological change and spurs economic growth. Empirical evidence is presented showing that democracy is in fact a significant determinant of total factor productivity (TFP) growth between 1960 and 1990 in a cross-section of countries. But this contribution occurs only insofar as democratic institutions are associated with greater quality of governance.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {This paper seeks to clarify the difference between two markers of future time reference in the Cree language. The preverbal particles ta- (∼ ka-) and wî- have both generally been treated as future tense markers. While future tense is found to be sufficient characterization for ta-, wî- requires further consideration, resulting in the conclusion that, rather than simple tense, it marks prospective aspect. The characterization of wî- in this way ties together a number of alternate interpretations as secondary semantic and/or pragmatic offshoots of the basic category of the prospective. Though data are presented in the Plains Cree dialect, native-speaker judgments confirm the arguments for all the major western dialects, Plains, Woods, and Swampy Cree, as spoken in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

	abstract = {Sociophonetics is a sub-branch that has attracted attention recently. Advances in speech science and technological simulations allow increasingly sophisticated studies of language contact and change. Particularly at the level of pronunciation, these studies show that language variety is robust and socially embedded. Although the book assumes some knowledge of basic acoustics and variationist studies, the general introduction and the chapter and section introductions provide a review of practices in the field, including those of collection, analysis, and interpretation. Introduction: Sociophonetic studies of language variety production – And perception / Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis R. Preston – Part I. Studies of Production: 1. The Peripatetic History of Middle English / Alice Faber, Marianna Di Paolo, and Catherine T. Best – 2. Social and phonetic conditioners on the frequency and degree of 'intrusive /r/' in New Zealand English / Jen Hay and Margaret Maclagan – 3. Mexican-American identity and the acquisition of regional US English / Rebecca Roeder – 4. Rhythm types and the speech of working-class youth in a banlieue of Paris: The role of vowel elision and devoicing / Zsuzsanna Fagyal – 5. The sociophonetics of prosodic contours on NEG in three language communities: Teasing apart sociolinguistic and phonetic influences on speech / Malcah Yaeger-Dror, Shoji Takano, Tania Granadillo, and Lauren Hall-Lew – 6. An emerging gender difference in Japanese vowel devoicing / Terumi Imai, Wittenberg College – Part II. Studies of Perception: 7. Regional stereotypes and the perception of Japanese vowel devoicing / Midori Yonezawa Morris – 8. Phonetic detail, linguistic experience, and the classification of regional language varieties in the United States / Cynthia G. Clopper – 9. Regional identity and the comprehension of varieties / Bartek Plichta and Brad Rakerd – 10. Belle's body just caught the fit gnat: The perception of Northern Cities Shifted vowels by local speakers / Dennis R. Preston – 11. Linguistic security, ideology, and vowel perception / Nancy Niedzielski – 12. Identification of African American speech / Erik R. Thomas, Norman E. Lass, and Jeannine Carpenter – Part III. Studies of perception and production: 13. Phonetic detail in the perception of ethnic varieties of US English / Thomas Purnell – 14. Sound judgements: Perception of indexical features in children's speech / Paul Foulkes, Gerard Docherty, Ghada Khattab, and Malcah Yaeger-Dror – 15. Avant-garde Dutch: A perceptual, acoustic and evaluational study / Renee van Bezooijen and Vincent J. van Heuven – 16.

	doi = {10.1007/s11525-016-9299-y},
	abstract = {This paper identifies two difficulties with treatments of derivation in Algonquian languages. In traditional approaches to grammar, in which the morpheme is seen as a unitary entity, morphemes are understood as minimal units of meaning and/or function. Definitions share an appeal to the morpheme’s indivisibility. In the Algonquianist literature, in contrast, some morphemes (‘components’) can themselves contain other morphemes (which we call ‘formatives’) and they can also be synchronically derived from other components or stems. Drawing data from Menominee, we propose that these difficulties disappear if the formatives are seen as historical rather than synchronic units, while the components are the synchronic morphemes. Formatives bear the hallmarks of historical products of morphologization (phonetic/phonological reduction, semantic bleaching, and increase in grammatical function), and we conclude that they are not part of synchronic grammatical computation. This resolves problems present in traditional and modern theoretical approaches to Algonquian derivation, and has broader ramifications for linguistic theory: in both the structuralist and generativist traditions, synchronic grammar has often been seen as expansive, responsible for generating surface patterns that may instead be products of history. This has been the case in phonology and syntax. The present paper provides a study of the phenomenon in derivational morphology, and suggests that a more modest role for synchronic rules is called for.},

	abstract = {Blackfoot verbal stems are usually classified by transitivity and animacy of the object (Taylor 1969, Frantz 1971, 1995), while the interaction between roots and suffixes remains uncharted. This paper argues that Blackfoot verbal roots and transitivity suffixes form heterogeneous subclasses based on their intrinsic transitivity. 1 Traditional classification of Blackfoot verbal stems Traditionally, verbal stems (root plus affixes) in Blackfoot are sub-classified on the basis of transitivity as well as the animacy of their argument. Intransitives verbs have one argument. Transitive stems require two arguments. In addition, all transitive stems are distinctly marked depending on whether their object is grammatically animate or inanimate. Similarly, intransitive verbs are traditionally sub-classified depending on the animacy of their subject. This stem-argument interaction is captured in the following classification: (1) Traditional classification of verbal stems in Algonquian (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] TA (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] TI (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] AI (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] II I will now go over the elements of the template. The preverb position hosts modal, temporal, aspectual and modifying prefixes. Suffixes that signal the transitivity (i.e., number of arguments) of the verb are analyzed as finals. Medials are modifying suffixes (mostly encoding manner). Preverbs and medials are not present in every verbal complex, while roots and finals are always required. Roots are simplex sound-meaning correspondences that finals and medials attach to when a stem is formed. As such, roots are essentially defined by their morpho-syntactic position. Animate transitive stems are TA, inanimate transitive-TI, animate intransitive-AI, and inanimate intransitive-II. Intransitive also includes pseudo intransitives (where an argument is optional). In (2), I illustrate how the template applies to a predicate: (2) áakaaminnima 2 yaak-ø-yaam-inn-i-wa},

The relevant facts are viewed from the perspective of the Distributed Morphology (DM) model of grammar (see, for example, Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994). The aim of this paper is to provide a unitary account of three previously unrelated facts. These are: (1) i. Allomorphy within the verb stem. ii. Certain morphemes occur either within the verb stem, or in “preverb position” (to the left of the verb stem). iii. In certain contexts, normal scopal relations within the verb stem are reversed.},

It is impossible to recruit staff with all these qualifications, particularly if higher degrees are required. Full-time library education following first degree will continue to be a normal route for entry to work in academic libraries, but this must be supplemented for those with higher degrees and mature entrants to the profession. The training of professional library staff must not be regarded as a once-for-all matter, but as a process continuing through life. Present facilities for part-time study are unsatisfactory. There is a need for the systematic organization of courses for those already in employment. These should be short, intensive, full-time courses, of the summer-school type, each dealing with one subject. Some such courses are now being organized, but they are not systematized and lead to no qualification. A programme of such courses, run by universities, library schools, libraries, and library organizations could be promoted by the Library Association and recognized for formal qualification. These courses would also provide for the need of practising librarians for ???refresher??? courses and training in new aspects of librarianship. ?? 1966, MCB UP Limited},

The first edition of Meet Cree, published in Canada in 1973, was addressed mainly to teachers, nurses, and other Euro-Canadians who live and work in communities speaking Cree, the most widely spoken indigenous language of Canada. The book was also used in courses on the structure of Cree and as background reading in spoken language programs. This new edition is meant as well for a third audience—general readers who may turn to a brief book on the Cree language simply from curiosity. Because virtually no other book presents a linguistic overview of any Native American language so soundly in terms of scholarship and pedagogy and yet so succinctly and clearly, Meet Cree has a special appeal for linguists and language teachers in the United States.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {It took 25 years to develop and arrive at a consensus for a standard orthography for the language of the Innu, or Montagnais, who live in Quebec and Labrador. The principal obstacle to standardization came from dialect diversity. An effort at standardizing the spelling system in the 1970s failed because speakers were not ready to let go of the writing system for their particular dialect, and they rejected a system that did not match their pronunciation. Another initiative in the 1980s made clear that speakers were to keep their accent, even when the spelling was standardized. A recognized authority for standardization of the spelling system was formed in the mid-1980s. At workshops attended by teachers and translators from all Innu communities, the orthography was largely standardized, although not all dialect variations were settled. A permanent committee formed in 1990 was charged with making decisions pertaining to standardization of spelling. Another series of workshops in 1997 tackled the problem of verb conjugations, and a consensus was reached on principles and rules for a common writing system. The work of promoting the spelling norm needs to be carried out for the whole population. Targeting young children is important because they have not yet acquired spelling habits and are not attached to any particular tradition. If the teaching of the Innu language were given more room in the school curriculum, the dissemination of the common spelling system could move forward. (Contains 18 references.) (TD)},

Empirical evidence is presented showing that the quality of governance is substantially higher in democratic countries. A general-equilibrium, endogenous growth model is then built to show how a governance-improving democracy raises growth. In this model, stronger democratic institutions influence governance by constraining the actions of corrupt officials. Reducing corruption, in turn, stimulates technological change and spurs economic growth. Empirical evidence is presented showing that democracy is in fact a significant determinant of total factor productivity (TFP) growth between 1960 and 1990 in a cross-section of countries. But this contribution occurs only insofar as democratic institutions are associated with greater quality of governance.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The preverbal particles ta- (∼ ka-) and wî- have both generally been treated as future tense markers. While future tense is found to be sufficient characterization for ta-, wî- requires further consideration, resulting in the conclusion that, rather than simple tense, it marks prospective aspect. The characterization of wî- in this way ties together a number of alternate interpretations as secondary semantic and/or pragmatic offshoots of the basic category of the prospective. Though data are presented in the Plains Cree dialect, native-speaker judgments confirm the arguments for all the major western dialects, Plains, Woods, and Swampy Cree, as spoken in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Based on a detailed investigation of the syntax and semantics of two series of person proclitics in Blackfoot (Algonquian: Alberta), we argue that in addition to traditional Φ\{phonetic\}-features, personal pronouns may also contain a temporal component that conditions their distribution and interpretation. Specifically, we propose that one series of Blackfoot proclitics consists of morphosyntactically simplex pro-Φ\{phonetic\}Ps that only encode person features, while the other series are morphosyntactically complex pro-DPs composed of a Φ\{phonetic\}P plus a D head. The semantic contribution of the D head is temporal: it restricts the denotation of the proclitic to a contextually relevant stage of an individual. We argue that this restriction conditions the distribution of the long forms; they appear in contexts which only involve a temporally restricted stage of the individual. We discuss three such contexts: inalienable possession, the perfect, and epistemic modality. The short form proclitics, which lack this temporal restriction, appear in contexts that do not refer to specific stage. Regarding their external syntax, we argue that the short form proclitics are introduced directly by a lexical head (N or V), whereas the long forms are introduced higher in the functional structure, by Poss and INFL.},

	abstract = {Brendan Fairbanks examines the challenging subject of discourse markers in Ojibwe, one of the many indigenous languages in the Algonquian family. Mille Lacs elder Jim Clark once described the discourse markers as “little bugs that are holding on for dear life.” For example, discourse markers such as mii and gosha exist only on the periphery of sentences to provide either cohesion or nuance to utterances. Fairbanks focuses on the discourse markers that are the most ubiquitous and that exist most commonly within Ojibwe texts. Much of the research on Algonquian languages has concentrated primarily on the core morphological and syntactical characteristics of their sentence structure. Fairbanks restricts his study to markers that are far more elusive and difficult in terms of semantic ambiguity and their contribution to sentences and Ojibwe discourse. Ojibwe Discourse Markers is a remarkable study that interprets and describes the Ojibwe language in its broader theoretical concerns in the field of linguistics. With a scholarly and pedagogical introductory chapter and a glossary of technical terms, this book will be useful to instructors and students of Ojibwe as a second language in language revival and maintenance programs.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is twofold. First, we claim that δ-features (discourse features), as well as ϕ-features, can be inherited from C to T (Richards 2007, Chomsky 2008), as shown by wh-agreement on T in Ojibwe (Algonquian). Our analysis supports Miyagawa's (2010) hypothesis that discourse and agreement features are two sides of the same coin, which can be distributed differently crosslinguistically. Second, we propose that although ϕ and δ typically bundle together on a single C head, this is not the case in all languages and in fact will vary parametrically. Ojibwe clause typing is partitioned between agreement/ϕ-features on independent order (i.e., plain matrix) C and discourse/δ-features on conjunct order (e.g., embedded) C. This parameter, that certain features may or may not bundle on C, captures a significant cluster of properties in Ojibwe: Initial Change, lack of person prefixes in the conjunct order in contrast with the independent, as well as the availability of long-distance agreement. Our proposal supports the idea that much crosslinguistic variation reduces to the distinct feature structures making up functional heads, such as v, D, and C, rather than to primitives.},

Here I discuss just one feature of Blackfoot verbal morphology which, even in the context of discussion of syntax, can be viewed as an anomaly.

The Problem A large number of logically transitive verbs sitive (AI) as evidenced by their inflection. 2 (l)-(3) the verb inflection "cross-references" 3 subject: (1) Nit-ohpommaa 1'ksisako-i. l-buy(AI) meat-nonpartic 'I bought meat.'},

	abstract = {Sociophonetics is a sub-branch that has attracted attention recently. Advances in speech science and technological simulations allow increasingly sophisticated studies of language contact and change. Particularly at the level of pronunciation, these studies show that language variety is robust and socially embedded. Although the book assumes some knowledge of basic acoustics and variationist studies, the general introduction and the chapter and section introductions provide a review of practices in the field, including those of collection, analysis, and interpretation. Introduction: Sociophonetic studies of language variety production – And perception / Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis R. Preston – Part I. Studies of Production: 1. The Peripatetic History of Middle English / Alice Faber, Marianna Di Paolo, and Catherine T. Best – 2. Social and phonetic conditioners on the frequency and degree of 'intrusive /r/' in New Zealand English / Jen Hay and Margaret Maclagan – 3. Mexican-American identity and the acquisition of regional US English / Rebecca Roeder – 4. Rhythm types and the speech of working-class youth in a banlieue of Paris: The role of vowel elision and devoicing / Zsuzsanna Fagyal – 5. The sociophonetics of prosodic contours on NEG in three language communities: Teasing apart sociolinguistic and phonetic influences on speech / Malcah Yaeger-Dror, Shoji Takano, Tania Granadillo, and Lauren Hall-Lew – 6. An emerging gender difference in Japanese vowel devoicing / Terumi Imai, Wittenberg College – Part II. Studies of Perception: 7. Regional stereotypes and the perception of Japanese vowel devoicing / Midori Yonezawa Morris – 8. Phonetic detail, linguistic experience, and the classification of regional language varieties in the United States / Cynthia G. Clopper – 9. Regional identity and the comprehension of varieties / Bartek Plichta and Brad Rakerd – 10. Belle's body just caught the fit gnat: The perception of Northern Cities Shifted vowels by local speakers / Dennis R. Preston – 11. Linguistic security, ideology, and vowel perception / Nancy Niedzielski – 12. Identification of African American speech / Erik R. Thomas, Norman E. Lass, and Jeannine Carpenter – Part III. Studies of perception and production: 13. Phonetic detail in the perception of ethnic varieties of US English / Thomas Purnell – 14. Sound judgements: Perception of indexical features in children's speech / Paul Foulkes, Gerard Docherty, Ghada Khattab, and Malcah Yaeger-Dror – 15. Avant-garde Dutch: A perceptual, acoustic and evaluational study / Renee van Bezooijen and Vincent J. van Heuven – 16. The imitation of language varieties: Production and perception / Betsy Evans – 17. The cycle of production, ideology, and perception in the speech of Memphis, TN / Valerie Fridland.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11525-016-9299-y},
	abstract = {This paper identifies two difficulties with treatments of derivation in Algonquian languages. In traditional approaches to grammar, in which the morpheme is seen as a unitary entity, morphemes are understood as minimal units of meaning and/or function. Definitions share an appeal to the morpheme’s indivisibility. In the Algonquianist literature, in contrast, some morphemes (‘components’) can themselves contain other morphemes (which we call ‘formatives’) and they can also be synchronically derived from other components or stems. Drawing data from Menominee, we propose that these difficulties disappear if the formatives are seen as historical rather than synchronic units, while the components are the synchronic morphemes. Formatives bear the hallmarks of historical products of morphologization (phonetic/phonological reduction, semantic bleaching, and increase in grammatical function), and we conclude that they are not part of synchronic grammatical computation. This resolves problems present in traditional and modern theoretical approaches to Algonquian derivation, and has broader ramifications for linguistic theory: in both the structuralist and generativist traditions, synchronic grammar has often been seen as expansive, responsible for generating surface patterns that may instead be products of history. This has been the case in phonology and syntax. The present paper provides a study of the phenomenon in derivational morphology, and suggests that a more modest role for synchronic rules is called for.},

	abstract = {Blackfoot verbal stems are usually classified by transitivity and animacy of the object (Taylor 1969, Frantz 1971, 1995), while the interaction between roots and suffixes remains uncharted. This paper argues that Blackfoot verbal roots and transitivity suffixes form heterogeneous subclasses based on their intrinsic transitivity. 1 Traditional classification of Blackfoot verbal stems Traditionally, verbal stems (root plus affixes) in Blackfoot are sub-classified on the basis of transitivity as well as the animacy of their argument. Intransitives verbs have one argument. Transitive stems require two arguments. In addition, all transitive stems are distinctly marked depending on whether their object is grammatically animate or inanimate. Similarly, intransitive verbs are traditionally sub-classified depending on the animacy of their subject. This stem-argument interaction is captured in the following classification: (1) Traditional classification of verbal stems in Algonquian (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] TA (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] TI (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] AI (Preverb) [Root (Medial) Final] II I will now go over the elements of the template. The preverb position hosts modal, temporal, aspectual and modifying prefixes. Suffixes that signal the transitivity (i.e., number of arguments) of the verb are analyzed as finals. Medials are modifying suffixes (mostly encoding manner). Preverbs and medials are not present in every verbal complex, while roots and finals are always required. Roots are simplex sound-meaning correspondences that finals and medials attach to when a stem is formed. As such, roots are essentially defined by their morpho-syntactic position. Animate transitive stems are TA, inanimate transitive-TI, animate intransitive-AI, and inanimate intransitive-II. Intransitive also includes pseudo intransitives (where an argument is optional). In (2), I illustrate how the template applies to a predicate: (2) áakaaminnima 2 yaak-ø-yaam-inn-i-wa},

The relevant facts are viewed from the perspective of the Distributed Morphology (DM) model of grammar (see, for example, Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994). The aim of this paper is to provide a unitary account of three previously unrelated facts. These are: (1) i. Allomorphy within the verb stem. ii. Certain morphemes occur either within the verb stem, or in “preverb position” (to the left of the verb stem). iii. In certain contexts, normal scopal relations within the verb stem are reversed.},

	abstract = {The qualifications needed for senior posts in academic libraries are 1. academic subject knowledge, to first degree level, but increasingly to higher degree level; 2. administrative and executive ability and experience; 3. knowledge of languages; 4. professional qualification in library techniques and bibliography. It is impossible to recruit staff with all these qualifications, particularly if higher degrees are required. Full-time library education following first degree will continue to be a normal route for entry to work in academic libraries, but this must be supplemented for those with higher degrees and mature entrants to the profession. The training of professional library staff must not be regarded as a once-for-all matter, but as a process continuing through life. Present facilities for part-time study are unsatisfactory. There is a need for the systematic organization of courses for those already in employment. These should be short, intensive, full-time courses, of the summer-school type, each dealing with one subject. Some such courses are now being organized, but they are not systematized and lead to no qualification. A programme of such courses, run by universities, library schools, libraries, and library organizations could be promoted by the Library Association and recognized for formal qualification. These courses would also provide for the need of practising librarians for ???refresher??? courses and training in new aspects of librarianship. ?? 1966, MCB UP Limited},

The first edition of Meet Cree, published in Canada in 1973, was addressed mainly to teachers, nurses, and other Euro-Canadians who live and work in communities speaking Cree, the most widely spoken indigenous language of Canada. The book was also used in courses on the structure of Cree and as background reading in spoken language programs. This new edition is meant as well for a third audience—general readers who may turn to a brief book on the Cree language simply from curiosity. Because virtually no other book presents a linguistic overview of any Native American language so soundly in terms of scholarship and pedagogy and yet so succinctly and clearly, Meet Cree has a special appeal for linguists and language teachers in the United States.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {It took 25 years to develop and arrive at a consensus for a standard orthography for the language of the Innu, or Montagnais, who live in Quebec and Labrador. The principal obstacle to standardization came from dialect diversity. An effort at standardizing the spelling system in the 1970s failed because speakers were not ready to let go of the writing system for their particular dialect, and they rejected a system that did not match their pronunciation. Another initiative in the 1980s made clear that speakers were to keep their accent, even when the spelling was standardized. A recognized authority for standardization of the spelling system was formed in the mid-1980s. At workshops attended by teachers and translators from all Innu communities, the orthography was largely standardized, although not all dialect variations were settled. A permanent committee formed in 1990 was charged with making decisions pertaining to standardization of spelling. Another series of workshops in 1997 tackled the problem of verb conjugations, and a consensus was reached on principles and rules for a common writing system. The work of promoting the spelling norm needs to be carried out for the whole population. Targeting young children is important because they have not yet acquired spelling habits and are not attached to any particular tradition. If the teaching of the Innu language were given more room in the school curriculum, the dissemination of the common spelling system could move forward. (Contains 18 references.) (TD)},

Empirical evidence is presented showing that the quality of governance is substantially higher in democratic countries. A general-equilibrium, endogenous growth model is then built to show how a governance-improving democracy raises growth. In this model, stronger democratic institutions influence governance by constraining the actions of corrupt officials. Reducing corruption, in turn, stimulates technological change and spurs economic growth. Empirical evidence is presented showing that democracy is in fact a significant determinant of total factor productivity (TFP) growth between 1960 and 1990 in a cross-section of countries. But this contribution occurs only insofar as democratic institutions are associated with greater quality of governance.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {This paper seeks to clarify the difference between two markers of future time reference in the Cree language. The preverbal particles ta- (∼ ka-) and wî- have both generally been treated as future tense markers. While future tense is found to be sufficient characterization for ta-, wî- requires further consideration, resulting in the conclusion that, rather than simple tense, it marks prospective aspect. The characterization of wî- in this way ties together a number of alternate interpretations as secondary semantic and/or pragmatic offshoots of the basic category of the prospective. Though data are presented in the Plains Cree dialect, native-speaker judgments confirm the arguments for all the major western dialects, Plains, Woods, and Swampy Cree, as spoken in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Based on a detailed investigation of the syntax and semantics of two series of person proclitics in Blackfoot (Algonquian: Alberta), we argue that in addition to traditional Φ\{phonetic\}-features, personal pronouns may also contain a temporal component that conditions their distribution and interpretation. Specifically, we propose that one series of Blackfoot proclitics consists of morphosyntactically simplex pro-Φ\{phonetic\}Ps that only encode person features, while the other series are morphosyntactically complex pro-DPs composed of a Φ\{phonetic\}P plus a D head. The semantic contribution of the D head is temporal: it restricts the denotation of the proclitic to a contextually relevant stage of an individual. We argue that this restriction conditions the distribution of the long forms; they appear in contexts which only involve a temporally restricted stage of the individual. We discuss three such contexts: inalienable possession, the perfect, and epistemic modality. The short form proclitics, which lack this temporal restriction, appear in contexts that do not refer to specific stage. Regarding their external syntax, we argue that the short form proclitics are introduced directly by a lexical head (N or V), whereas the long forms are introduced higher in the functional structure, by Poss and INFL.},

	abstract = {Brendan Fairbanks examines the challenging subject of discourse markers in Ojibwe, one of the many indigenous languages in the Algonquian family. Mille Lacs elder Jim Clark once described the discourse markers as “little bugs that are holding on for dear life.” For example, discourse markers such as mii and gosha exist only on the periphery of sentences to provide either cohesion or nuance to utterances. Fairbanks focuses on the discourse markers that are the most ubiquitous and that exist most commonly within Ojibwe texts. Much of the research on Algonquian languages has concentrated primarily on the core morphological and syntactical characteristics of their sentence structure. Fairbanks restricts his study to markers that are far more elusive and difficult in terms of semantic ambiguity and their contribution to sentences and Ojibwe discourse. Ojibwe Discourse Markers is a remarkable study that interprets and describes the Ojibwe language in its broader theoretical concerns in the field of linguistics. With a scholarly and pedagogical introductory chapter and a glossary of technical terms, this book will be useful to instructors and students of Ojibwe as a second language in language revival and maintenance programs.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is twofold. First, we claim that δ-features (discourse features), as well as ϕ-features, can be inherited from C to T (Richards 2007, Chomsky 2008), as shown by wh-agreement on T in Ojibwe (Algonquian). Our analysis supports Miyagawa's (2010) hypothesis that discourse and agreement features are two sides of the same coin, which can be distributed differently crosslinguistically. Second, we propose that although ϕ and δ typically bundle together on a single C head, this is not the case in all languages and in fact will vary parametrically. Ojibwe clause typing is partitioned between agreement/ϕ-features on independent order (i.e., plain matrix) C and discourse/δ-features on conjunct order (e.g., embedded) C. This parameter, that certain features may or may not bundle on C, captures a significant cluster of properties in Ojibwe: Initial Change, lack of person prefixes in the conjunct order in contrast with the independent, as well as the availability of long-distance agreement. Our proposal supports the idea that much crosslinguistic variation reduces to the distinct feature structures making up functional heads, such as v, D, and C, rather than to primitives.},
